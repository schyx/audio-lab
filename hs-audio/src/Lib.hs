-- |
-- - Reverse the input sound's samples.
-- - Output a new sound containing the samples of the input sound in reverse order, with the same input rate.
-- -
backwards :: Sound -> Sound

-- |
-- - Mix the two sounds with given ratio
-- - If the two sounds have different rates, or if one of the sounds is a mono sound
-- - and the other is a stereo sound, output Nothing
-- -
mix :: Sound -> Sound -> Double -> Maybe Sound

-- |
-- - Echo the given sound
-- - Compute a new signal consisting of several scaled-down and delayed version of the input sound.
-- -
echo :: Sound -> Int -> Double -> Double -> Sound

-- |
-- - If the input is a stereo sound, output Just the panned sound
-- - Otherwise, output Nothing

-- |
-- - If the input is a stereo sound, output the sound with vocals removed
